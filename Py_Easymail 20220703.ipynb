What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allans list;  the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith  on Wednesday  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic  consolidated position screen will be extremely difficult and time  consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday Keith alluded to the  inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the  consolidated position so the solution was to make it so that a trader can  arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to  happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the  consolidated position screen this is critical. This does not exclude  building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the  future but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm  requirements. Also to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project  plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.  The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to  themselves and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this  project.  I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been  good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams but now  we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.  Richard   ---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT on 10/06/2000  08:34 AM ---------------------------   Allan Severude 10/05/2000 06:03 PM To: Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Peggy Alix/HOU/ECT@ECT Russ Severson/HOU/ECT@ECT Scott  Mills/HOU/ECT@ECT Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list   From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated  positions I think we still have the following issues: We dont have a single point of contact from the trading group.  Weve had  three meetings which brought out very different issues from different  traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader  requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements. Were getting hit with a lot of different requests many of which appear to  be outside the scope of position consolidation.  Things left to do: I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to  make it as clear as possible what were trying to accomplish with this  project.  Itll help determine which requests fall under the project scope. Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this  project and which fall out of scope. For those in scope work to define relative importance (priority) of each and  work with traders to define the exact requirements of each. Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all  drill downs. Use the above to formulate a project plan.  Things requested thus far (no particular order): Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal  ticker. Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that  add up existing position manager rows/columns). New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical  transport swaps options ... Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values  of all curves on which the desk has a position. Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be  shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid  would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid. Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the  appropriate positions to show for each: Gas Daily for monthly index Physical gas for Nymex Physical gas for Inside Ferc Physical gas for Mid market. Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of  using official valuations. Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks. Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS: Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility  skew and correlations. Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.   Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a  gamma grid. Valuation of Gas Daily options. A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD. Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets. Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position  manager. Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms  prior deal terms and net P&L affect of the change. Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker. Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of  individual deals on the position total in a grid cell. Benchmark positions in TDS. Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit  and explicit position break out issues.  -- Allan.  PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for  transport.  Hopefully well know much better where that part stands at that  point.     ] \n","\n","Extractive summary using TF-IDF\n","Ligne  0  :  ['forwarded', 'phillip', 'k', 'allen', 'hou', 'ect', 'pm',

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allans list;  the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith  on Wednesday  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic  consolidated position screen will be extremely difficult and time  consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday Keith alluded to the  inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the  consolidated position so the solution was to make it so that a trader can  arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to  happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the  consolidated position screen this is critical. This does not exclude  building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the  future but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm  requirements. Also to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project  plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.  The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to  themselves and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this  project.  I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been  good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams but now  we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Weve had  three meetings which brought out very different issues from different  traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader  requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements. Were getting hit with a lot of different requests many of which appear to  be outside the scope of position consolidation.  Things left to do: I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to  make it as clear as possible what were trying to accomplish with this  project.  Itll help determine which requests fall under the project scope. Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this  project and which fall out of scope. For those in scope work to define relative importance (priority) of each and  work with traders to define the exact requirements of each. Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all  drill downs. Use the above to formulate a project plan.  Things requested thus far (no particular order): Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal  ticker. Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that  add up existing position manager rows/columns). New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical  transport swaps options ... Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values  of all curves on which the desk has a position. Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be  shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid  would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid. Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the  appropriate positions to show for each: Gas Daily for monthly index Physical gas for Nymex Physical gas for Inside Ferc Physical gas for Mid market. Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of  using official valuations. Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks. Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS: Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility  skew and correlations. Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.   Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a  gamma grid. Valuation of Gas Daily options. A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD. Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets. Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position  manager. Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms  prior deal terms and net P&L affect of the change. Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker. Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of  individual deals on the position total in a grid cell. Benchmark positions in TDS. Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit  and explicit position break out issues.  -- Allan.  PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for  transport.  Hopefully well know much better where that part stands at that  point.     ]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Ignoring args : (30, 100)\n","Token indices sequence length is longer than the specified maximum sequence length for this model (1215 > 1024).

The coronavirus first appeared in the form of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in Guangdong province, China, in 20027 followed by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) isolated from the sputum of a 60-year-old man who presented symptoms of acute pneumonia and subsequent renal failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012.8 In December 2019, a β-coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization (WHO) has named the new disease as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee has named it as SARS-CoV-2.9,10 Based on the results of sequencing and evolutionary analysis of the viral genome, bats appear to be responsible for transmitting the virus to humans\"\"\"\n","print(text)\n","\n","print(summarize_abstractive (text))\n","print(summarize_spacy (text))\n","print()"],"metadata":{"id":"7Zzdcajk9iFi","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1656944052176,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Nico T","userId":"09615745923254077330"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["A voir"],"metadata":{"id":"NiR7gR20Jioc"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/text-summarization-approaches-nlp-example/\n","# https://towardsdatascience.com/abstractive-summarization-using-pytorch-f5063e67510\n","# https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/10/text-summarization-using-the-conventional-hugging-face-transformer-and-cosine-similarity/\n"],"metadata":{"id":"S4nzClf9GUpR","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1656944052176,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Nico T","userId":"09615745923254077330"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"QZkhkSMqy-o_","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1656944052177,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Nico T","userId":"09615745923254077330"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Archived"],"metadata":{"id":"dpzo6gk-5TKc"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"UlrXYw1g5YLv","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1656944052179,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":14,"user":{"displayName":"Nico T","userId":"09615745923254077330"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"collapsed_sections":["-ZKemb11VlJD","hYIaLzOZxTLL"],"name":"Py_Easymail 20220703.ipynb","provenance":[{"file_id":"https://github.com/franckglastre/NLP-Datascientest/blob/Nicolas/Py_Easymail.ipynb","timestamp":1656881904177}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
