What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allans list;  the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith  on Wednesday  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic  consolidated position screen will be extremely difficult and time  consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday Keith alluded to the  inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the  consolidated position so the solution was to make it so that a trader can  arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to  happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the  consolidated position screen this is critical. This does not exclude  building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the  future but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm  requirements. Also to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project  plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.  The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to  themselves and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this  project.  I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been  good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams but now  we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Weve had  three meetings which brought out very different issues from different  traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader  requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements. Were getting hit with a lot of different requests many of which appear to  be outside the scope of position consolidation.  Things left to do: I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to  make it as clear as possible what were trying to accomplish with this  project.  Itll help determine which requests fall under the project scope. Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this  project and which fall out of scope. For those in scope work to define relative importance (priority) of each and  work with traders to define the exact requirements of each. Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all  drill downs. Use the above to formulate a project plan.  Things requested thus far (no particular order): Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal  ticker. Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that  add up existing position manager rows/columns). New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical  transport swaps options ... Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values  of all curves on which the desk has a position. Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be  shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid  would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid. Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the  appropriate positions to show for each: Gas Daily for monthly index Physical gas for Nymex Physical gas for Inside Ferc Physical gas for Mid market. Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of  using official valuations. Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks. Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS: Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility  skew and correlations. Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.   Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a  gamma grid. Valuation of Gas Daily options. A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD. Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets. Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position  manager. Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms  prior deal terms and net P&L affect of the change. Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker. Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of  individual deals on the position total in a grid cell. Benchmark positions in TDS. Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit  and explicit position break out issues.  -- Allan.  PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for  transport.

We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader  requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.

Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values  of all curves on which the desk has a position. Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be  shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid  would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid. Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the  appropriate positions to show for each: Gas Daily for monthly index Physical gas for Nymex Physical gas for Inside Ferc Physical gas for Mid market. Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of  using official valuations. Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks. Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS: Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility  skew and correlations. Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.   Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a  gamma grid. Valuation of Gas Daily options. A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD. Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allans list;  the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith  on Wednesday  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic  consolidated position screen will be extremely difficult and time  consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday Keith alluded to the  inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the  consolidated position so the solution was to make it so that a trader can  arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to  happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the  consolidated position screen this is critical. This does not exclude  building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the  future but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm  requirements. Also to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project  plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.  The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to  themselves and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this  project.

It appears that a single  buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above  market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades  offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were  bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index  calculation.  Additionally these trades are out of line with the associated  financial swaps for San Juan.   We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from  September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from  Enron Online (EOL) Enrons direct phone conversations and three brokerage  firms (Amerex APB and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a  trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas  daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread  relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:   1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75480) are much greater  than the high financial trades (4.63754.665) on those days.    2.

Crocker  <clclegal2@aol.com>  Subject: Investment Structure   STRUCTURE: Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC) general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction.  LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investors share of profits is reduced.  All loans for residential construction that are intended for re-sale are full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit engineering & architectural design soils tests surveys filing fees legal fees for organization and condominium association formation  and appraisals.  Unlike many real estate investment programs none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  EARLY LAND COSTS The $4000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  As an alternative we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680000 this would mean a land loan of $476000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3966 given a 10% annual interest rate plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements referred to as the fiscals.  This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  As such they have to be counted as a development cost even though they are not spent.  Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot which I suspect will be at least $20000 and potentially as high as $25000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15000 on $20000 per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9000 fiscals at $2000 and the land cost at $8000  total improved lot cost is $19000 which means $0 to $4000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  Thus the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184000.   Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units the total lot improvement cost might average $31000 per lot.   Of this probably $13000 would be for improvements and $19000 for the land cost.  The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs the entry road water treatment costs perimeter fencing and landscaping and so on as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value which I would estimate as $10000 per lot for a loan value of $7000 per lot.  Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15000 per lot.  This would give you a total loan of $992000 total cost of $1232645 for equity required of $241000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans.  First is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  Third is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs then to necessary reserves then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  For example if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub or cannot find enough trim carpenters etc. and it decides to undertake this function it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own any significant equipment but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing cornice roofing and drywall spreading.  REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based reporting.  BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?  Please expand.  INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investors input on design and materials.  As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you and I presume Keith want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating.  CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally for vendors they are constantly shopped.  PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS SUBS AND VENDORS Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can provide these if you are interested.  I know I have not answered everything but this is a starting point.  Call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit engineering & architectural design soils tests surveys filing fees legal fees for organization and condominium association formation  and appraisals. The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value which I would estimate as $10000 per lot for a loan value of $7000 per lot. This would produce a loan amount of  $15000 on $20000 per lot. EARLY LAND COSTS The $4000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer. The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land financing and sales costs. The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot which I suspect will be at least $20000 and potentially as high as $25000.

Crocker  <clclegal2@aol.com>  Subject: Investment Structure   STRUCTURE: Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC) general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction.  LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investors share of profits is reduced.  All loans for residential construction that are intended for re-sale are full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit engineering & architectural design soils tests surveys filing fees legal fees for organization and condominium association formation  and appraisals.  Unlike many real estate investment programs none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  EARLY LAND COSTS The $4000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  As an alternative we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680000 this would mean a land loan of $476000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3966 given a 10% annual interest rate plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements referred to as the fiscals.  This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  As such they have to be counted as a development cost even though they are not spent.  Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot which I suspect will be at least $20000 and potentially as high as $25000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15000 on $20000 per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9000 fiscals at $2000 and the land cost at $8000  total improved lot cost is $19000 which means $0 to $4000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  Thus the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184000.   Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units the total lot improvement cost might average $31000 per lot.   Of this probably $13000 would be for improvements and $19000 for the land cost.  The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs the entry road water treatment costs perimeter fencing and landscaping and so on as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value which I would estimate as $10000 per lot for a loan value of $7000 per lot.  Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15000 per lot.  This would give you a total loan of $992000 total cost of $1232645 for equity required of $241000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans.  First is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  Third is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs then to necessary reserves then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  For example if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub or cannot find enough trim carpenters etc. and it decides to undertake this function it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own any significant equipment but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing cornice roofing and drywall spreading.

Second  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit but the loan remains in the builder/developers name. CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans. USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit engineering & architectural design soils tests surveys filing fees legal fees for organization and condominium association formation  and appraisals. The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value which I would estimate as $10000 per lot for a loan value of $7000 per lot. This would produce a loan amount of  $15000 on $20000 per lot. EARLY LAND COSTS The $4000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer. The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land financing and sales costs. The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot which I suspect will be at least $20000 and potentially as high as $25000. The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs the entry road water treatment costs perimeter fencing and landscaping and so on as well as for 100% of the land.\n","paramètres : 30 100\n","texte :  8500 [ ---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000  04:26 PM ---------------------------   George Richards <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/26/2000 01:18:45 PM Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> To: Phillip Allen <pallen@enron.com> cc: Larry Lewter <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> Claudia L. Crocker  <clclegal2@aol.com>  Subject: Investment Structure   STRUCTURE: Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC) general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction.  LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investors share of profits is reduced.  All loans for residential construction that are intended for re-sale are full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit engineering & architectural design soils tests surveys filing fees legal fees for organization and condominium association formation  and appraisals.  Unlike many real estate investment programs none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  EARLY LAND COSTS The $4000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  As an alternative we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680000 this would mean a land loan of $476000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3966 given a 10% annual interest rate plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements referred to as the fiscals.  This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  As such they have to be counted as a development cost even though they are not spent.  Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot which I suspect will be at least $20000 and potentially as high as $25000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15000 on $20000 per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9000 fiscals at $2000 and the land cost at $8000  total improved lot cost is $19000 which means $0 to $4000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  Thus the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184000.   Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units the total lot improvement cost might average $31000 per lot.   Of this probably $13000 would be for improvements and $19000 for the land cost.  The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs the entry road water treatment costs perimeter fencing and landscaping and so on as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value which I would estimate as $10000 per lot for a loan value of $7000 per lot.  Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15000 per lot.  This would give you a total loan of $992000 total cost of $1232645 for equity required of $241000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans.  First is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  Third is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs then to necessary reserves then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  For example if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub or cannot find enough trim carpenters etc. and it decides to undertake this function it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own any significant equipment but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing cornice roofing and drywall spreading.  REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based reporting.  BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?  Please expand.  INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investors input on design and materials.  As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you and I presume Keith want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating.  CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally for vendors they are constantly shopped.  PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS SUBS AND VENDORS Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can provide these if you are interested.  I know I have not answered everything but this is a starting point.  Call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Is the closing today?? After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isnt binding  as far as I can determine.? It is  too vague and it doesnt sound like  anything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate  closing--but of course I could be  wrong.?  ? If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is  no point in me  following up on this?documents validity.?  ? I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see whats there and  find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can. ? I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable  document or something a little more exact or  rather?sort of a contract.?  This isnt either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last  night but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said  this is out of his area but doesnt  sound binding to him.?  ? I will go back to mine and Phillip Allens  transaction?and take a look at  that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even  needed to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any  need to contact me regarding the  closing. ?

As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As it is in the Smart Growth Corridor area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months.  Additionally many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement I used this data to be cautious.  The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680000 and an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at $700000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. I regret that it took so long to get back to you but we had some unusual events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week..

As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As it is in the Smart Growth Corridor area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months.  Additionally many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement I used this data to be cautious.  The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680000 and an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at $700000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. I regret that it took so long to get back to you but we had some unusual events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take my wife  to emergency.

As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As it is in the Smart Growth Corridor area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months.  Additionally many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement I used this data to be cautious.  The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680000 and an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at $700000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. I regret that it took so long to get back to you but we had some unusual events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. George W.

As for rent-ability I believe that we have shown that the 3-bedroom 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact if we were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom units along with the 3-bedroom plan. Phillip I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.

As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As it is in the Smart Growth Corridor area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months.  Additionally many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement I used this data to be cautious.  The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680000 and an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at $700000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. I regret that it took so long to get back to you but we had some unusual events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week..

I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were  built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for   around $2 million. ($182000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated  that he had more units under construction that would be   available in the 180s.  Are the units he is selling significantly different  from yours?

If you havent taken the time to update your GIS  information please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed  as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days  ago and if you have any questions regarding this request please feel free to  call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.  With Enrons rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees  between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to  have one process that will enable us to collect  update and retain employee  data.  In the spirit of One Enron and building on the success of the  year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process the  Enron VP/MD PRC  requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their  profiles. Current responsibilities employment history skills and education  need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is  accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to  hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com  on the command line of your browser.  The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would  like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned  for input or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please  contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.    Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.      Thanks   Dave]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Ignoring args : (30, 100)\n","Token indices sequence length is longer than the specified maximum sequence length for this model (2401 > 1024).

The coronavirus first appeared in the form of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in Guangdong province, China, in 20027 followed by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) isolated from the sputum of a 60-year-old man who presented symptoms of acute pneumonia and subsequent renal failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012.8 In December 2019, a β-coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization (WHO) has named the new disease as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee has named it as SARS-CoV-2.9,10 Based on the results of sequencing and evolutionary analysis of the viral genome, bats appear to be responsible for transmitting the virus to
