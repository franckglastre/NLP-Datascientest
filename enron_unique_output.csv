This would produce a loan amount of $15,000 on $20,000, per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, fiscals at, $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000, which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to, obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement, provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the, improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. Even if the maximum loan would, cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds, spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the, preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a, tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can, significantly reduce the cash equity requirement , Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total, lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. Of this, probably, $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. The, improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design, costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and, landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. The land loan for, undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would, estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. Then the, loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. This would give, you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required, of $241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing, is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the, separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility, standpoint , CONSTRUCTION LOANS, There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative, spec loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. Second, is, a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the, builder/developers name. Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction, loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to, start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans, in the name of the builder/developer. We do not expect to have any, construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too, difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process , Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for, pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will, be from 80% to 95% of value , DISBURSEMENTS, Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and, near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority, payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner, will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the, fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to, 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to, calculation of profit, except for a direct reimbursement for partnership, expenses and b direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has, to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or, cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc and it decides to undertake this, function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain, from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is, used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own, any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track, to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading , REPORTING, We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan What did you have in mind? I would like to use some form of internet based, reporting , BOOKKEEPING, I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, Bookkeeping, procedures to record actual expenses? Please expand , INVESTOR INPUT, We are glad to have the investors input on design and materials. As always, the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my, experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume, Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every, effort to be accommodating , CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES, CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as, formal as your question indicates. In the EXTREMELY tight labor market, obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. For the professional, subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. Finally for vendors they are constantly shopped , PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS, Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can, provide these if you are interested , I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at, probably 70% of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase, price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated, monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus, approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees , EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN, Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require, the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as, the fiscals. This cost represents a bond for the completion of, improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the, improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be, for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after, completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should, expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot, improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an, irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a, development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not, spent no interest is charged on these funds , The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a, finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as, high as $25,000. This would produce a loan amount of $15,000 on $20,000, per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, fiscals at, $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000, which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to, obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement, provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the, improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. Even if the maximum loan would, cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds, spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the, preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a, tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can, significantly reduce the cash equity requirement , Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total, lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. Of this, probably, $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. The, improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design, costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and, landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. The land loan for, undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would, estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. Then the, loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. This would give, you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required, of $241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing, is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the, separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility, standpoint , CONSTRUCTION LOANS, There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative, spec loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. Second, is, a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the, builder/developers name. Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction, loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to, start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans, in the name of the builder/developer. We do not expect to have any, construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too, difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process , Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for, pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will, be from 80% to 95% of value , DISBURSEMENTS, Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and, near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority, payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner, will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the, fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to, 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to, calculation of profit, except for a direct reimbursement for partnership, expenses and b direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has, to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or, cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc and it decides to undertake this, function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain, from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is, used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own, any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track, to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading , REPORTING, We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan What did you have in mind? I would like to use some form of internet based, reporting , BOOKKEEPING, I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, Bookkeeping, procedures to record actual expenses? Please expand , INVESTOR INPUT, We are glad to have the investors input on design and materials. As always, the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my, experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume, Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every, effort to be accommodating , CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES, CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as, formal as your question indicates. In the EXTREMELY tight labor market, obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. For the professional, subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. Finally for vendors they are constantly shopped , PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS, Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can, provide these if you are interested , I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. Call, when you have reviewed and we can discuss further , Sincerely , George Richards, President, Creekside Builders, LLC , - winmail.dat, ","{0: ['forwarded', 'phillip', 'k', 'allen', 'hou', 'ect',

You would need to discuss this with an, exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San, Antonio if you do not know anyone I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to, schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as, your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any, time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either, 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is, 512-338-1103. I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you, on this project that is sure to be a major winner I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual, events these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg, downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to, start the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough, to knock it down. The City shut down the project for a week and it took, another week to get every thing back on tract. Then last week I had to take, my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra, in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this, past week.. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize, the enormous number of things she does everyday. Fortunately, it looks as, if she will be ok in the long run George W.

As you can tell from the proforma this project, should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as, Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for, this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we, have uncovered to date in the Austin market The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As, it is in the Smart Growth Corridor area designated by the City of Austin, for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete, in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe, water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot, improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North, Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street, widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street, widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond, requirement, I used this data to be cautious The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not, expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite, successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the, adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods, is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may, only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far, preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer, preferences The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and, an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site, plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into, an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the, profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss, having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity, with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a, 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a, rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then, be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an, exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San, Antonio if you do not know anyone I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to, schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as, your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any, time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either, 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is, 512-338-1103. I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you, on this project that is sure to be a major winner I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual, events these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg, downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to, start the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough, to knock it down. The City shut down the project for a week and it took, another week to get every thing back on tract. Then last week I had to take, my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra, in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this, past week.. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize, the enormous number of things she does everyday. Fortunately, it looks as, if she will be ok in the long run George W.
