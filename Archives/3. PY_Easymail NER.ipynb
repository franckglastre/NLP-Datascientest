Thanks , 1. Forward Contracting and Bilateral Contracting, a. Expectations are that the supply/demand balance for Summer 2001, will again be tight b. All 3 IOUs have an interest in managing their risk exposure, i. increasing undercollections, ii. reducing headroom for CTC collection, c. Uncertainty around CPUC reasonableness review has stifled IOU, contracting activity, d. Reasonableness must be upfront and not backward looking, i. competitive bid public agencies do this, utility sale of, generating assets provides a tangible measure of IOUs selection, ii. recommend a portfolio approach various block sizes, various, terms, various pricing, iii. most PBRs compare short-term market indices to utility, portfolio costs. It is another way of determining reasonableness , 2. Determination of IOU obligation for procurement is key to providing, direction on forward contracting Reasonableness is a CPUC issue. Default Provider would require, legislation, a. Question about whether IOUs should continue to be procurers of, energy for customers b. In the interim, after the freeze, IOUs may need to continue as, default provider to residential and small commercial customers to, provide rate stability b. IOUs should not continue a default provider role for large, commercial/industrial accounts, but only a provider of last resort, c. Large commercial/industrial customers have no continuing cost, obligation for procurement service from utility d. Commission should investigate alternatives to utility default, provider within 2 years. PECO just held an auction 3 companies bid TNPC won e. Utility contracts should consider potential of customers to DA and, potential for alternative default provider f. Utilities default could be a portfolio i.e. Oregon . Residential, and small commercial customers could choose from a limited number of, services such as spot, 1-year fixed , 3. Utility Undercollections/Rate Freeze, a. Commission is examining accounting changes to mitigate SCE/PG&E, undercollection problem b. TURN has proposed collapsing undercollection with stranded costs, and continuing the current statutory period for collection. We support c. May need legislation if carry any undercollections into, post-freeze d. Continuation of rate freeze would require legislation. May be, cleaner to run rate freeze through current deadline and look at a rate, stabilization proposal to replace frozen rates for 2002 e. Ending the rate freeze early will prematurely expose customers to, fluctuation f. Undercollection issue is a snapshot in time. Allow rate freeze to, continue gives opportunity to mitigate current position g. Utilities are generating revenues in excess of costs.

I reserved a room for Pat, Cal and myself, but was unsure what other reservations to make for the rest of the group because some of you are still tentative and Im not sure who is bringing SOs/dates. , , The inn has one room called the Blue Iris room with two double beds that might work for Jeff W. and Jeff D. if going up single; most of their other rooms have a queen or king bed the Meadow View king room sounded nice for a couple if we have any going up . Both of those are still available for the weekend we are planning to be there. I think there may be some cottages available also for multiple people, but Im not sure what the configurations of those are. A full breakfast can be ordered from some of the rooms for $14.00 extra. They serve breakfast at 8:00 a.m. Pat, Cal and I have a suite with a small kitchen, so we may also be able to host some minimal meals/snacks/drinks. , , The phone number of Cleone Gardens is 1-800-400-2189.

The transaction has continued to develop along the lines of my last update of , 11-21-00. The terms and economics remain essentially as outlined on , 11-21-00. In summary, the primary form of consideration will be a , derivative-like commodity agreement or a contract for differences. This , contract will be exchanged in full for the SubNotes and the majority of our , equity interest. The JEDI II equity interest will also receive a residual , contingent interest which will become payable in the event of a PPA , restructuring at the Linden facility. We are calling the derivative a swap , but it is more like a receivable. An El Paso affiliate guaranteed by El , Paso as parent will notionally be paying NYMEX plus approx $0.52 , escalating over seven years on a notional volume of 300,000 MMBtu/d and , receiving NYMEX. With netting the contract is simply a series of fixed , quarterly payments over seven years. No offset rights and no limitations on , the guarantee - fully a stand alone agreement. We are optimistic that we may be able to sign documents as early as Thursday , night. This agreement can be terminated at our option in the event that we , do not receive the necessary internal approvals. There are only two , significant external approvals required, a NJ Environmental , non-applicability determination and ECP credit ratings reaffirmation. , Accordingly we expect at this time to receive the necessary internal and , external approvals and close by year end. We expect that a public , announcement would be appropriate at the time both parties have received all , necessary internal approvals , The portion of the commodity contract being exchanged for the SubNotes is , expected to be offered to Condor to monetize this portion of the contract at , year end. Subsequent to Condors acquisition of its contract, both JEDI IIs , contract and the Condor contract are expected to be monetized in a QSPE , vehicle later in the first quarter.

I am sure Doug Leach has mentioned to you the mark-to-market and accrual income exposure of $14 million should the FMA also were rescinded or parlayed in the final resolution. EFI is continuing to invoice for the Fixed Fee every month although the plant is not operating as is DPC to MSEB , Mr. Talwars view is that as long as the PPA is valid, EFI has the right to collect the fee. If, however, the PPA is declared to be invalid as per MSEBs claim, then EFI would not be entitled to the fee , I just want to point out that as DPC and Enron is working for a resolution, EFIs role should also be considered. And along those lines, EFI should take an active role in pursuing that its interest is protected , Please call me at 35336 to discuss , -- Tushar, , -----Original Message-----, From: Edison, Andrew , Sent: Saturday, September 22, 2001 4:40 PM, To: Viverito, John; Leach, Doug; Dhruv, Tushar, Cc: Aronowitz, Alan, Subject: FW: Fuel Management Agreement , Gentlemen:, , I think this e-mail I received early Saturday morning directly and succinctly answers the questions we posed to Indian counsel.

There is no theory under Indian law that Enron could use, to make an enforceable claim against MSEB in the context of the facts placed before us , 2. The concept of agency relationships does exist under Indian Contract Law. The concept of third party beneficiary claims does not exist under Indian Contract Law. However, Enron cannot make use of the agency relationship theory as the Agreement has not, apart from stating that DPC will be Enrons agent, stated that DPC will be acting under the Agreement as agent for Enron for all purposes , 3. Yes, our view is that Enron has no enforceable claim against MSEB on the basis of the facts placed before us and the provisions of the Agreement. However, if DPC makes a claim against MSEB and a judgment is awarded to DPC for recovery of the Fixed Fee, either as such or by way of damage, then Enron would have a right to attach the amount that may be payable by MSEB to DPC , Kind regards , Suresh , -----Original Message----- From: Andrew.Edison@enron.com SMTP:Andrew.Edison@enron.com Sent: Friday, September 21, 2001 6:41 PM To: suresh.talwar@crawfordbayley.com Cc: kiran.khanna@crawfordbayley.com Subject: RE: Fuel Management Agreement I am a little bit confused.

These include amongst others, approving of the Fuel Management Plan proposed by the Fuel Manager, providing copies to the Fuel Manager of notices issued by MSEB to DPC pursuant to certain clauses in the PPA, etc , There is no provision in the Agreement to suggest that Enron has entered into the Agreement relying on the continued subsistence of the PPA and no commitment has been made by MSEB under the Agreement in that behalf , Enrons right to the Fixed Fee from DPC under the Agreement, is contingent upon DPC being paid the corresponding PPA Fuel Management Fee by MSEB. I assume that the only parties to the PPA are DPC and MSEB , The payment of the PPA Fuel Management Fee by MSEB to DPC is governed by the provisions of the PPA, to which Enron is not a party. Therefore there is no privity of contract between Enron and MSEB/DPC as regards the PPA. As a result, Enron has no claim against MSEB for non-payment of the PPA Fuel Management Fee to DPC and therefore has no claim against MSEB under the Agreement as there is no breach by MSEB of its functions under the Agreement , I trust I have answered your query adequately.

This decision was reached in cooperation with Enrons Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately , To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company. Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enrons stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees , The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy. This individual will join Enrons remaining management team to direct the companys ongoing operations , I truly believe Enron can and will survive. I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does , During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity. I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the worlds most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.

If it is, we will probably need to revisit the gamma calculation , since we are not currently including any cross terms for gamma , Thanks , Stinson , \n","df_emails['NER_body'][id] : (Stinson, Vince Stinson Gibner, 11/30/2000 06:14 PM, Alex Huang/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vasant Shanbhogue/HOU/ECT@ECT, 1, Paulo, 2, one, 3, Edith, Stinson)\n","\n","\n","()\n","(Stinson, Vince Stinson Gibner, 11/30/2000 06:14 PM, Alex Huang/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vasant Shanbhogue/HOU/ECT@ECT, 1, Paulo, 2, one, 3, Edith, Stinson)\n","\n"," ID: 33\n","33  - header : Re: real options openings?\n","df_emails['NER_header'][id] : ()\n","33  - body : X-bcc: , X-Folder: Vincent_Kaminski_Jun2001_6Notes FoldersAll documents, X-Origin: Kaminski-V, X-FileName: vkamins.nsf Shirley , Austin.

DF , Mark Knippa@ECT, 02/05/2001 05:28 PM, To: Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, cc: Susan Scott/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Gerald Nemec/HOU/ECT@ECT, James , Centilli/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Kevin Hyatt/ET&S/Enron@Enron Subject: Gallup Station - Demand Rebate Hey Drew , Sorry that we did not get to meet last week when you were in town. I have , pulled up some information on the project performance and wanted to share , with the group. I was very concerned by the comment that the project was on , a rate to cost TW an additional $1.0 million for the year because the demand , avoidance program was not in place. I do want to confirm that Arnold , Eisenstein at ET&S working on the development of the programming to support , TWs efforts to minimize demand expenses. It was my understanding during the , development of this project, that TW was targeting a 75% avoidance for an , annual basis. I offer the following details regarding the actual operation , of the station in 2000 , Peak load for 12,000 hp = 9,621 kw x 3 = 28,864.0 kw per Quarter Actual Utilization, 3rd Quarter 2000 % of Max 4th Quarter 2000 % of Max, kw - generation 22,684.8 78.6 17,779 61.6, kw - transmission 25,421.0 88.1 22,992 79.6, , Target $s @ 75% 99,142 75.0 73,480 75.0, Net Actual Rebate $s 75,935 78.6 105,181 61.59, difference $23,206 $31,702 Overall net for 2000 under Rate 21 appears to reflect that TW has saved , $8,496 above their target rebate of $170,622 75% avoidance for the 3rd and , 4th quarters. In addition, ECS has made payment to TW under Rate 19 that , resulted in an additional $118,441 paid to TW. Note that ECS has proposed , to included the transmission demand in the Rebate process which is not , specifically addressed the Compression Service Agreement. , Currently TW has access to the web site that graphically displays the current , Tri-State generation load as well as several years of month by month , history. This access was conveyed to TW as soon as the confidentiality , agreement between TW, ECS and Tri-State was executed and delivered to ECS. , At this point, EE&CC now under ET&S was notified that the system access was , available to package the load monitoring programming. As I mentioned above that effort is underway. I will be glad to meet and/or discuss these issues when you are available. I , will be travelling most of the next 2 weeks but you can reach me via email , or my, cell phone 713 851-7703. Based on the information that I was able to pull , together, I just dont see the magnitude of dollars that seems to have TW , concerned I would like to discuss at your earliest convenience , Thanks mk \n","df_emails['NER_body'][id] : (X-Origin, Mark, DF, Mark Knippa@ECT, 05:28 PM, Drew Fossum/ET&S, Susan Scott, Gerald Nemec/HOU/ECT@ECT, James , Centilli/ET&S, Kevin Hyatt/ET&S, Subject: Gallup Station - Demand Rebate Hey Drew, last week, TW, the year, Arnold, Eisenstein, ET&S, TW, 75%, 2000, Peak, 12,000 hp, 9,621, 3, 28,864.0, Quarter Actual Utilization, Max, Max, 17,779, 61.6, 25,421.0, Target, 75%, Net Actual Rebate $s, 105,181, 61.59, $23,206 $, 31,702, 2000, TW, 8,496, 170,622, 75%, 3rd, 4th, ECS, TW, an additional $118,441, TW, ECS, the Compression Service Agreement, TW, several years of month, TW, TW, ECS, Tri-State, ET&S, the next 2 weeks, 713, TW)\n","\n","\n","()\n","(X-Origin, Mark, DF, Mark Knippa@ECT, 05:28 PM, Drew Fossum/ET&S, Susan Scott, Gerald Nemec/HOU/ECT@ECT, James , Centilli/ET&S, Kevin Hyatt/ET&S, Subject: Gallup Station - Demand Rebate Hey Drew, last week, TW, the year, Arnold, Eisenstein, ET&S, TW, 75%, 2000, Peak, 12,000 hp, 9,621, 3, 28,864.0, Quarter Actual Utilization, Max, Max, 17,779, 61.6, 25,421.0, Target, 75%, Net Actual Rebate $s, 105,181, 61.59, $23,206 $, 31,702, 2000, TW, 8,496, 170,622, 75%, 3rd, 4th, ECS, TW, an additional $118,441, TW, ECS, the Compression Service Agreement, TW, several years of month, TW, TW, ECS, Tri-State, ET&S, the next 2 weeks, 713, TW)\n","\n"," ID: 62\n","62  - header : TXU\n","df_emails['NER_header'][id] : (TXU,)\n","62  - body :  Dan Carrie 214-875-9351 is the accountant at TXU that will have wire information.\n","df_emails['NER_body'][id] : (Dan Carrie, 214, TXU)\n","\n","\n","(TXU,)\n","(Dan Carrie, 214, TXU)\n","\n"," ID: 63\n","63  - header : Re: Planning and Zoning Meeting for Tuesday, February 6\n","df_emails['NER_header'][id] : (Tuesday, February 6)\n","63  - body :  I can be there , Susan David Moss <CityMgr@southside-place.org> on 01/31/2001 12:08:23 PM, To: jpiper5360@aol.com <jpiper5360@aol.com> susan.w.pereira@enron.com <susan.w.pereira@enron.com>, cc: , Subject: Planning and Zoning Meeting for Tuesday, February 6 , John and Susan: Would you be available to meet at 6:30 P.M. for a Planning and Zoning, Meeting to finalize the ordinance? dnm \n","df_emails['NER_body'][id] : (Susan David Moss, jpiper5360@aol.com <jpiper5360@aol.com, Tuesday, February 6, John, Susan, 6:30 P.M.)\n","\n","\n","(Tuesday, February 6)\n","(Susan David Moss, jpiper5360@aol.com <jpiper5360@aol.com, Tuesday, February 6, John, Susan, 6:30 P.M.)\n","\n"," ID: 64\n","64  - header : Kids Unlimited\n","df_emails['NER_header'][id] : ()\n","64  - body :  Please forward your list of events/ place me on the distribution list , Thanks! , Debra Perlingiere, Enron North America Corp Legal Department, 1400 Smith Street, EB 3885, Houston, Texas 77002, dperlin@enron.com, Phone 713-853-7658, Fax 713-646-3490\n","df_emails['NER_body'][id] : (Debra Perlingiere, Enron North America Corp Legal Department, 1400, Smith Street, 3885, Houston, Texas, 713-853-7658)\n","\n","\n","()\n","(Debra Perlingiere, Enron North America Corp Legal Department, 1400, Smith Street, 3885, Houston, Texas, 713-853-7658)\n","\n"," ID: 65\n","65  - header : Delivering Intel(R) technology to your inbox\n","df_emails['NER_header'][id] : ()\n","65  - body :  Intel, Home Computing Newsletter <http://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/header.gif>t, <http://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif>, <http://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/orangeboxtop.gif>t, <http://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif>t <http://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif>t <http://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif> <http://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/boxtop.gif>t, <http://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif>t <http://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif>tsend to a friend <http://intel.m0.net/m/s.asp?HB5171890317X1175188X89215Xpplatte%40enron.com>t <http://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif>t <http://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif>t, <http://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif>, Hello Phil, t <http://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif>, January 2002 t, , What better way to start the new year than with new advancements in technology.

Yesterday, we received revised numbers on first quarter productivity, which, came in at -1.2% quarter-over-quarter on an annualized basis. On a, year-over-year basis, productivity remains at a relatively healthy 2.5%, rate, although this is half the pace at which it was running less than one, year ago. A slowdown in productivity is not unusual during an economic, slowdown. Corporations face fixed costs, while business is declining Unfortunately, that is why there are layoffs. With lower corporate costs productivity should improve as the economy picks up steam. Tomorrow, the, market will be receiving the weekly initial jobless claims, which are, expected to remain near last weeks level. Lehman Brothers economists look, for first-time unemployment insurance filings to total 415,000 for the week, ended Saturday, June 2 , The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.65% The 10-year note yield is 5.25% The 5-year is trading at 4.83% Spot crude oil is trading at $27.44 p/b Natural Gas - Henry Hub - is trading at $3.85 p/mcf , tttAD Time: New Federal Insider-Trading Rule Rule 10b5-1 have been adopted by the SEC, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an, insiders/employees ability to trade his/her corporate shares during, blackout periods Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and, insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and, sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan, was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession, of material, non-public information The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully , Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the, regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.

We attribute this to some, concerns around the recent acquisitions, the need to access the public, markets to finance these deals and the increase in DSOs and the, drop in cash flow reported in 1Q01 *Late last week we had a private call with the controller of EDS to address, the balance sheet issues. We believe that the key issue is, the volume of large deals ramping in 1H01. Receivable terms on large, outsourcing deals are often extended in the early stages of, contracts. On selected large deals, we also suspect that EDS and perhaps, others may be offering up-front price discounts, adding to, the cash flow requirement although average margins over the life of a, contract appear stable.

The, entire loss, between existing and new policies combined, would translate, only into about a 5 % to 10 % loss of revenues and earnings, companywide because estate planning is only a portion of their business , Albertsons, Inc ABS 3 - Market Perform M.
