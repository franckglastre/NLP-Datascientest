Crocker , <clclegal2@aol.com> , Subject: Investment Structure , STRUCTURE:, Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate or LLC , general partner. The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the, liability of construction , LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS, The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and, any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in, the name of the limited partnership. Each of the individual investors and, all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the, loans. If the investor s do not sign on the loans, this generally means, that a larger amount of cash is required and the investors share of profits, is reduced , All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are, full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be, non-recourse , USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT, The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &, architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for, organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike, many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to, Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over, the estimated 6 month design and approval period , EARLY LAND COSTS, The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost, represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of, extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at, probably 70% of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase, price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated, monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus, approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees , EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN, Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require, the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as, the fiscals. This cost represents a bond for the completion of, improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the, improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be, for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after, completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should, expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot, improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an, irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a, development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not, spent no interest is charged on these funds , The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a, finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as, high as $25,000. This would produce a loan amount of $15,000 on $20,000, per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, fiscals at, $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000, which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to, obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement, provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the, improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. Even if the maximum loan would, cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds, spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the, preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a, tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can, significantly reduce the cash equity requirement , Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total, lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. Of this, probably, $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. The, improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design, costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and, landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. The land loan for, undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would, estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. Then the, loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. This would give, you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required, of $241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing, is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the, separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility, standpoint , CONSTRUCTION LOANS, There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative, spec loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. Second, is, a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the, builder/developers name. Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction, loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to, start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans, in the name of the builder/developer. We do not expect to have any, construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too, difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process , Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for, pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will, be from 80% to 95% of value , DISBURSEMENTS, Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and, near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority, payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner, will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the, fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to, 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to, calculation of profit, except for a direct reimbursement for partnership, expenses and b direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has, to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or, cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc and it decides to undertake this, function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain, from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is, used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own, any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track, to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading , REPORTING, We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan What did you have in mind? I would like to use some form of internet based, reporting , BOOKKEEPING, I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, Bookkeeping, procedures to record actual expenses? Please expand , INVESTOR INPUT, We are glad to have the investors input on design and materials. As always, the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my, experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume, Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every, effort to be accommodating , CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES, CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as, formal as your question indicates. In the EXTREMELY tight labor market, obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. For the professional, subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.

Crocker , <clclegal2@aol.com> , Subject: Investment Structure , STRUCTURE:, Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate or LLC , general partner. The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the, liability of construction , LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS, The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and, any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in, the name of the limited partnership. Each of the individual investors and, all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the, loans. If the investor s do not sign on the loans, this generally means, that a larger amount of cash is required and the investors share of profits, is reduced , All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are, full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be, non-recourse , USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT, The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &, architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for, organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike, many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to, Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over, the estimated 6 month design and approval period , EARLY LAND COSTS, The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost, represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of, extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at, probably 70% of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase, price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated, monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus, approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees , EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN, Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require, the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as, the fiscals. This cost represents a bond for the completion of, improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the, improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be, for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after, completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should, expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot, improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an, irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a, development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not, spent no interest is charged on these funds , The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a, finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as, high as $25,000. This would produce a loan amount of $15,000 on $20,000, per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, fiscals at, $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000, which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to, obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement, provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the, improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. Even if the maximum loan would, cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds, spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the, preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a, tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can, significantly reduce the cash equity requirement , Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total, lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. Of this, probably, $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. The, improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design, costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and, landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. The land loan for, undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would, estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. Then the, loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. This would give, you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required, of $241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing, is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the, separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility, standpoint , CONSTRUCTION LOANS, There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative, spec loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. Second, is, a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the, builder/developers name. Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction, loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to, start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans, in the name of the builder/developer. We do not expect to have any, construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too, difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process , Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for, pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will, be from 80% to 95% of value , DISBURSEMENTS, Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and, near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority, payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner, will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the, fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to, 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to, calculation of profit, except for a direct reimbursement for partnership, expenses and b direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has, to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or, cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc and it decides to undertake this, function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain, from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is, used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own, any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track, to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading , REPORTING, We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan What did you have in mind? I would like to use some form of internet based, reporting , BOOKKEEPING, I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, Bookkeeping, procedures to record actual expenses? Please expand , INVESTOR INPUT, We are glad to have the investors input on design and materials. As always, the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my, experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume, Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every, effort to be accommodating , CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES, CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as, formal as your question indicates. In the EXTREMELY tight labor market, obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. For the professional, subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.

This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we', 'have uncovered to date in the Austin market.', 'The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As', 'it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin', 'for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete', 'in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe', 'water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot', 'improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North', 'Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street', 'widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street', 'widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond', 'requirement, I used this data to be cautious.', ' The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not', 'expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite', 'successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the', 'adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.', 'As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods', 'is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may', 'only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far', 'preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer', 'preferences.', 'The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and', 'an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site', 'plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into', 'an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.', 'This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the', 'profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss', 'having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity', 'with your profit in the lot.

You would need to discuss this with an', 'exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San', 'Antonio if you do not know anyone.', 'I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,', 'by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.', 'Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to', 'schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as', 'your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any', 'time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either', '512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is', '512-338-1103.

As you can tell from the proforma this project, should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as, Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for, this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we, have uncovered to date in the Austin market The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As, it is in the Smart Growth Corridor area designated by the City of Austin, for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete, in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe, water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot, improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North, Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street, widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street, widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond, requirement, I used this data to be cautious The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not, expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite, successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the, adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods, is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may, only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far, preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer, preferences The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and, an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site, plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into, an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the, profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss, having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity, with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a, 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a, rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then, be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an, exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San, Antonio if you do not know anyone I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to, schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as, your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any, time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either, 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is, 512-338-1103. I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you, on this project that is sure to be a major winner I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual, events these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg, downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to, start the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough, to knock it down. The City shut down the project for a week and it took, another week to get every thing back on tract. Then last week I had to take, my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra, in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this, past week.. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize, the enormous number of things she does everyday. Fortunately, it looks as, if she will be ok in the long run George W.

Also, if you want me to , get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and , Ill take care of it. , On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate , curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of , $235,019. , If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your , overall p&l. Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects , something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal , #s, paths and p&l impacts of each 139195 From Kingsgate to Malin $182,030 , 139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora $ 4,024 , 139197 From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin $ 8,271 , 231321 From Kingsgate to Malin $ 38,705 , 153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield $ 1,988 , Suggested fix: Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to , GDP-Kingsgate , Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five , different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for , withdrawals and the other four are injections. Clay Basin is valued as a , Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points. What this means is , that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport , losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport. , Im not sure of the best way to handle this since we dont really have a , systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals. In an ideal world, it seems , that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times the transport cost would pass through as storage costs. Anyway, heres the , detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it , appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin. There may be , an operational reason why this occurred that Im not aware of, and the dollar , impact is very small, but I thought Id bring it to your attention just in , case theres something you want to do about it.

pass the bridge , loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very , difficult , The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state , would eat the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General , Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 , billion.However, sources report this bill may be , amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen currently in AB 8X. Senator Bowens language states that the state should , get paid before the utilities from rate payments which, if passed, would be , likely to cause a SoCal bankruptcy , According to sources close to the Republicans in the legislature Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money , available in the General Fund.Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full , disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis, including the , details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they , will support the bond issuance to go forward , Currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan; AB 8X and AB , 31X. AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.If you have any questions, please contact Kristin Walsh at 713 853-9510 , Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack , of Support, Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the , bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.The $5 billion , authorized under SB 6X is not the same as the $5 billion that must be , authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased, or the , additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing , power going forward.The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond , issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X bridge loan , stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers then the utilities would receive the residual amount.",0.9805739022711004,Erreur,0.0,See Original,0.07661430712492925,0.9805739022711004

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia, Hydro & Power Authority X.BCH , is the only energy company in the Northwest, region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid, about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening But that still wasnt enough juice The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts, of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of, $250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts, of power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the, $250/MWh price cap The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The, municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power, into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP, is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit, claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville, Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the, market at prices 10 times higher Powerex officials wouldnt comment on the ISO power sale, saying all, transactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000, megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts, - for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state, no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having, to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing, to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during, a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency, Wednesday, but wouldnt order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared, when the ISOs operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is, interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as, a means of attracting additional electricity resources In order to line up more power we have to be in a dire situation Dorinson said Edison International unit EIX Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy, unit SRE San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. PCG unit Pacific Gas &, Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of, the high-priced power SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high, wholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by, nearly $1 billion, analysts said. Its still unclear whether retail, customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity, rates or if companies will absorb the costs -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;, jason.leopold@dowjones.com, END Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00, 1318GMT Copyright c 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc, 13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay, Pwr Plant, This article was originally published Wednesday , LOS ANGELES Dow Jones --Representatives of the California Independent, System Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy, Corp.s DUK off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif. Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state, since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the, reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said About 11,000 MW of power has been off the states power grid since Monday 7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the, ISO The ISO manages grid reliability As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy, Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert, at 5 PM PST 0100 GMT Thursday , meaning power reserves in the state would, dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid, collapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldnt result in rolling, blackouts The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc DYN Reliant Energy Inc.

AES and Dynegy Inc. DYN said, Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by, some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate, reasons The California Independent System Operator, which manages the states power, grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public, Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power, plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for, unplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency, for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and, customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be, called on to do so As reported earlier, Reliant Energy REI and Southern Energy Inc. SOE , said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday, evening Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES, and Dynegy Tuesday evening AES told the visitors they couldnt perform an unannounced full inspection, of the companys 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday, morning, when the plants full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron, Thomas said Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didnt know whether the representatives, returned Wednesday for a full inspection , AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have, used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down, two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality, Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed Thomas said AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire, Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos, and Redondo Beach plants The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES, has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the, company $20 million for polluting Wed be happy to put our units back, provided we dont get sued for it Thomas said. Its not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality, districts authority As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES, could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off, line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so , Dynegys El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC Dynegy Inc. DYN said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday, evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line, Wednesday I guess our position is, Gee, were sorry you dont believe us, but if you, need to come and take a look for yourself, thats fine, said Dynegy, spokesman Lynn Lednicky Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and, the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could, pose a safety hazard if not repaired Weve been doing all we can to get back in service, Lednicky said. We, even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegys explanation of, why its units were off line -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872 jessica.berthold@dowjones.com, END Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00, 1317GMT Copyright c 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc , G_nther A.

--The California Independent System Operator paid, about $10 million Wednesday for 1,000 megawatts of power from Powerex and, still faced a massive deficit that threatened electricity reliability in the, state, high-ranking market sources familiar with the ISOs operation told, Dow Jones Newswires But the ISO fell short of ordering rolling blackouts Wednesday for the third, consecutive day The ISO wouldnt comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market, information.Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state, since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the, reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said About 11,000 MW of power has been off the states power grid since Monday 7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the, ISO The ISO manages grid reliability As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy, Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert, at 5 PM PST 0100 GMT Thursday , meaning power reserves in the state would, dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid, collapse.The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency, for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and, customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be, called on to do so As reported earlier, Reliant Energy REI and Southern Energy Inc. SOE , said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday, evening Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES, and Dynegy Tuesday evening AES told the visitors they couldnt perform an unannounced full inspection, of the companys 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday, morning, when the plants full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron, Thomas said Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didnt know whether the representatives, returned Wednesday for a full inspection , AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have, used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits.Its not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality, districts authority As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES, could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off, line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so , Dynegys El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC Dynegy Inc. DYN said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday, evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line, Wednesday I guess our position is, Gee, were sorry you dont believe us, but if you, need to come and take a look for yourself, thats fine, said Dynegy, spokesman Lynn Lednicky Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and, the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could, pose a safety hazard if not repaired Weve been doing all we can to get back in service, Lednicky said.Dow Jones --AES Corp. AES and Dynegy Inc. DYN said, Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by, some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate, reasons The California Independent System Operator, which manages the states power, grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public, Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power, plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for, unplanned maintenance.",0.9892373464218351,Erreur,0.0,See Original,0.10838928921504998,0.9892373464218351

Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and , repairs. Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor , cost for repairs. There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on , repairs , 2. What is an outside management firm going to do? A full time onsite , manager is all that is required. As I mentioned the prior manager has , interest in returning. Another alternative would be to hire a male manager , that could do more make readies and lawn care. If you turn it over to a , management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager , onsite , 3. Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated. If you , want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest , 4. Getting cash out is not a priority to me. So I am willing to structure , this deal with minimum cash.

Cash Needs, Highlights:, SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=, plete=20, cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20, program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=, s=20, and other measures.=20, Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20, available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=, .8=20, million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20, conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date II. Credit Relationships, Highlights:, SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20, extend or renew credit as it has become due At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=, lt.=20, Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=, nd=20, payable SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=, =20, indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20, indebtedness if it were feasible to do so Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =, its=20, rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=, =20, issues within the last three weeks III. Energy Cost Scenarios, Highlights, This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20, various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=, such=20, scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001 IV. Cost Containment Initiatives, Highlights, SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001 The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=, =20, improvement component as follows in millions :, Operating and maintenance costs $ 77, Capital Improvement Costs 383, Total $ 460, The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=, =20, be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=, om=20, contract employees Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=, =20, most part being deferred to a future date SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20, executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20, savings of approximately $92 million V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery TRA and TCBA=20, Activity , Highlights:, As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20, Transition Cost Balancing Account TCBA Account of $494.5 million. This=20, includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20, million and accelerated revenues of $175 million As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=, =20, Transition Account TRA of $4.49 billion Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=, e=20, end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=, =20, balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20, D.01-01-018 Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20, generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20, tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20, expressed in the TRA, are overstated TURN Proposal, As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=, RN=20, to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=, s.=20, Our comments are summarized as follows:, The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=, t=20, would not directly generate nor use cash The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=, ift=20, costs between two regulatory assets TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=, the=20, revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =, in=20, the TRA is overstated VI. Flow of Funds Analysis, Highlights:, In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=, =20, positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to=, =20, its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=, =20, shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=, on=20, stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=, ve=20, and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes there is no Section VII, =20, VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates, SCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500=, =20, million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20, In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.=, =20, This increase correlates to the increase in market prices, for natural gas for the same period A copy of the report is

before an industry conference and blamed the markets speculators for , the rise in gas prices , Its my firm belief ... that todays gas prices are being manipulated, Adik , told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly , In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric , utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry , Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame , for this winters startling gas bills, having failed to protect their , customers and constituents from such price spikes , Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take , precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price , insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas , prices before they soared , Were passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over, said Paul , Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy , But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers , Theres been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to , change, said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security , Analysis Inc an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass Hot topic Consumers know one thing for certain:And big gas consumers, from , utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc can lock in what , they pay for the gas they expect to use , There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention , of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge , of natural gas , But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders dont need to , know much about gas -- or whatever commodity theyre trading.By the end of the month it was nearly $10 Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Associations , weekly storage numbers , Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to , need in the winter , Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than , average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in , hopes that the summers unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop , Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be , sufficient.futures prices , dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet Just passing through Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but , pass their fuel costs on to customers , Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers cost-of-gas , charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet.And Missouri Gas , Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday , Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last , month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could , be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve , energy , Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to , save an average customer about $25 this winter , Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star, Date: 01/20/01 22:15 As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile , Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas , storage number , The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the , forecast was for frigid weather.",0.9975673993642327,Erreur,0.0,See Original,0.03077947181470997,0.9975673993642327
